OpenVAS is an open-source vulnerability scanning and management tool that helps to identify security issues like misconfigurations, outdated software, and weak passwords that could be exploited by attackers. OpenVAS is widely used by security professionals to assess and improve the security posture of their networks and is known for its effectiveness and flexibility.
OpenVAS consists of a server and various client-side tools for scanning and reporting. It uses a regularly updated database of known vulnerabilities and checks systems against these to detect potential weaknesses. The tool performs a comprehensive scan of the specified targets, identifying potential vulnerabilities such as outdated software, misconfigurations, and weak passwords and generates comprehensive reports detailing the identified vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for remediation.
Classifies the system resources.
Allocates the enumerable values to the classified resources.
Detects the possible threats (vulnerabilities) in each resource.
Eliminates the vulnerabilities on a priority basis.
we have to download this throgh kali linux 
then we have to run the vulnerability scanning 
it will take half an hr time and analysis our system 
if any vulnerbality is found we have to analysis them 
Vulnerability scanners detect security weaknesses by systematically scanning systems, networks, and applications, comparing discovered information against a database of known vulnerabilities, and then reporting the findings. 
The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a framework used to assess and rate the severity of software vulnerabilities. It provides a standardized way to communicate the potential impact of a vulnerability, helping organizations prioritize their remediation efforts.
